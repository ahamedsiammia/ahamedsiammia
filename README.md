<h1 align="center" text="10xl"> Hi,👋 This is Siam Ahamed</h1>

<h1> 👤 About me</h1>
<p>I am a passionate MERN Stack Developer who builds user-friendly and responsive web applications. I mainly use React.js and Tailwind CSS to create clean, modern, and responsive user interfaces.
On the backend, I work with Node.js and MongoDB to build secure and scalable applications. I enjoy turning ideas into real products and focusing on performance, usability, and clean code.
I always try to learn new technologies and improve my development skills. I enjoy working both in a team and independently, and I love building real-world projects that solve practical problems.
My goal is to grow as a full-stack developer and work on impactful projects that make users’ lives easier.</p>
